### 🌱 I’m currently learning

Using **v0** and **Cursor** to support my development and assist with learning.  
**v0** helps me build clean React frontends with **shadcn/ui**, while **Cursor** boosts backend productivity with AI agents and allows me to ask questions across multiple top models.

I’m also exploring **shadcn/ui** and learning **Inertia.js** for React frontend interfaces in **BookSafe**, and plan to move to the **Next.js** framework for my next project.

### 💡 Future Goals
Planning a **TikTok-style app** using the **Product Hunt API** to explore endless product ideas to help people discover what to their project will be.
The TikTok-style app will be integrated with Next.js instead of Inertia.js.
